# AI Avatar Generator

Welcome to the AI Avatar Generator project! ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This project is an AI experiment born to simplify the process of bringing together two amazing GitHub projects to obtain your avatar. 
Leveraging the power of generative AI algorithms, this experiment showcases the creative potential of merging existing projects to produce something entirely new and entertaining.

## Features
* **Face Swapping with roop**
    * Utilizes the [roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop) GitHub project to seamlessly swap faces, allowing you to swap your face/character on a video of your choice.
* **Lip Movement Synchronization with Wav2Lip**
    * Integrates the [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip)   GitHub project to synchronize lip movement with your voice, enhancing the realism of the video.

## Getting Started
To get started with your own **AI Avatar Generator**, follow these simple steps:

1. Use Google Colab to use the GPU

2. Download [HowToUse.ipynb](https://github.com/dip9811111/YourAIAvatar/blob/main/HowToUse.ipynb) and upload it in your Google Drive.

3. Clone this repository: 
```git clone https://github.com/dip9811111/YourAIAvatar.git```
    * Replace the image, video, and audio you want to use.

5. Simply run all the cells of the Notebook.

6. Enjoy the hilariously generated post-match interview video!

## Acknowledgments
